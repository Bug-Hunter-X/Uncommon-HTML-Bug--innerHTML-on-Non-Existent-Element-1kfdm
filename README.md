# Uncommon HTML Bug: innerHTML on Non-Existent Element

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug related to using `innerHTML` in JavaScript with an element that doesn't exist in the HTML document.  The code doesn't throw an error, but it also fails to produce the expected output, leading to unexpected behavior.

The `bug.html` file contains the buggy code, while `bugSolution.html` provides a corrected version. The bug is that the script attempts to modify the innerHTML of an element that does not exist in the HTML, which is a common situation during dynamic page loading.
